   <p><h1>So, what made me want to learn coding? Well... I can't remember much on why, but, I'll try to explain.</h1></p>
   <hr>
   <p>So, when I was younger, I had a BIG love for computing. I would ask my mum if I could have a computer every now and then. Not much luck until christmas of 2023, where i opened that present and I WAS THRILLED.</p>
   <p>I looked at my present and it was a refurbished thinkpad t430. My first computer. I instantly booted it up. Then, there was the setup screen. My dad had to sort it out before i could use it, but lets skip to the coding part.</p>
   <p>I loved to code on Scratch, I also made a game called defying gravity on it (go check it out!) but, I wanted to ACTUALLY CODE. Well, I can't remember the part until, 'Codemonkey' was set up for me.</p>
   <p>Codemonkey teaches a simplified version of a language called CoffeeScript and Python. so, i finished the course, and loved it. Only soon I would find out that it was NOT used outside of Codemonkey.</p>
   <p>Then, I started to learn Python. I knew this was an actual mainstream language, as i had heard of it before, so I started doing the upper part of Codemonkey. But, I would stop using it for long after that. i got too interested in FNF, and alternative provision just stole my time.</p>
   <p>But soon, I would slide back on track again. So, I did some reasearch on when i would learn real time input, but that... Wouldn't happen on the CodeMonkey course. so i stopped using it. And soon learned that Codemonkey wasn't teaching real Coffescript after a shot at coming back to it.</p>
   <p>Oh god, did I delete the rest? Well, that stinks. (WAA) anyways, just a little summary of right now, i'm learning css, i finished learning pygame and html, i got a better school, and life is good </p>
