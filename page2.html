   <p><h1>So, what made me want to learn coding? Well... I can't remember much on why, but, I'll try to explain.</h1></p>
   <hr>
   <p>So, when I was younger, I had a BIG love for computing. I would ask my mum if I could have a computer every now and then. Not much luck until christmas of 2023, where I opened that present and I WAS THRILLED.</p>
   <p>I looked at my present and it was a refurbished thinkpad t430. My first computer. I instantly booted it up. Then, there was the setup screen. My dad had to sort it out before I could use it, but lets skip to the coding part.</p>
   <p>I loved to code on Scratch, I also made a game called defying gravity on it (go check it out!) but, I wanted to ACTUALLY CODE. Well, I can't remember the part until, 'Codemonkey' was set up for me.</p>
   <p>Codemonkey teaches a simplified version of a language called CoffeeScript and Python. so, I finished the course, and loved it. Only soon I would find out that it was NOT used outside of Codemonkey.</p>
   <p>Then, I started to learn Python. I knew this was an actual mainstream language, as I had heard of it before, so I started doing the upper part of Codemonkey. But, I would stop using it for long after that. I got too interested in FNF, and alternative provision just stole my time.</p>
   <p>But soon, I would slide back on track again. So, I did some reasearch on when I would learn real time input, but.... I learnt that wouldn't happen on the CodeMonkey course. so I stopped using it. And soon learned that Codemonkey wasn't teaching real Coffescript after a shot at coming back to it.</p>
   <p>After getting a new school, I would start to be taught python and pygame, which made me start on a youtube tutorial on pygame by Clear code. And soon enough, I knew how to code (mostly) in pygame!</p>
   <p>I took a purposeful break after acheiving a very good accomplishment. and I started learning Roblox Lua. and after another part that I can't remember.</p>
   <p>One day, I would decide to make something like codemonkey, but in python. and after a few hours, i would achieve a point where I could stop, and I will keep working on it soon.</p>
   <p>At the start of August of 2025, I would start working on my roblox game: INFECTED AWAKENING. First, I made the zombies follow and chase me. Then, I made them damage me. After that, I made a title screen. And last, I made the map.</p>
   <p>The next day, I started working on this website. I wanted to learn JavaScript first but then realised html would be better.</p>
   <p>Lastly, is today. I managed to get a development bud. He helped me expand the map while I would fail on making an intermission and round system. I also managed to find someone to code the intermission and round system for me, and I also paid them 125 robux.</p>

   And that's it. After that, is me typing this down at this very moment. That basically sums up how i got my coding interest. bOI!
